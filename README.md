My own implementation of a kanban board made just for fun and nothing more. Web client. For the backend please see **kabanserver** repo.

**Used technologies / design approaches:**
- Old fashioned non-SPA site
- Vanilla.js (no side libs were used for drag and drop)
- LESS for styles
- Separation into components / pages
- Gulp.js for kickking the application off


**Features:**
- Managing boards, cards:
  - Create / Update / Archive them
  - Setting board wallpapers / card covers
  - Setting boards / cards description
- Cards drag and drop (it's almost trello, right?)
- Searching user boards
- User profile management (at least as a sketch)

There are many features I'd like to implement, like users collaboration, tagging, etc. Little by little I'm going to implement them, plus many other ones. 


A couple of screens:
